                            Karting: multiple title winner and seven years in the National Karting squad <br />
                            <br />
                            Valtteri Bottas began his career racing karts at the age of six. Over the next decade he amassed countless race wins, many championships and a seven-year stint in Finland’s National Karting squad. <br />
                            <br />
                            After winning three prestigious kart titles in 2006, Valtteri moved into single-seaters. He won both the 2008 Formula Renault Eurocup and the 2008 Formula Renault Northern European Cup, winning 17 races from 28 starts. <br /> <br />

                            Despite not winning a race in 2009, Valtteri claimed two poles and secured third in the Formula 3 Euroseries. In June of the same year he won the Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort, a title he won again in 2010 and he remains the only driver ever to have won the title twice. Valtteri remained with ART’s F3 team in 2010, securing two victories en route to third place in the championship. In 2011 he won the GP3 Series at the first attempt, claiming a win at each of the last four race weekends to secure the title in the penultimate race. <br /> <br />

                            He was assigned test driver for Williams in 2010 and ’11, before becoming reserve driver in 2012 taking part in 15 practice sessions over the course of the season. After impressing the team, he was duly promoted to a race seat and competed in his debut FIA Formula One World Championship season with the Williams F1 Team in 2013. Valtteri achieved his first ever Formula One podium finish in Austria in 2014, throughout that season he gained a further five podiums and finished a career best of fourth in the Drivers’ Championship. <br /> <br />

                            In 2015 Valtteri scored two podiums at the Canadian Grand Prix and the Mexican Grand Prix, and finished fifth in the Drivers’ Championship with 136 points.
